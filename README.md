Starting the project, you'll notice that the challenge instructions are very simple. All we want to do is to be able to add notes and delete notes from our keeper app. The final functionality that you're looking for is when we add a note with a new title and when we click the Add button it clears those inputs and pushes a new note into our array of notes.

## Instructions

<br>

1. Implement the add note functionality.
    1. Create a constant that keeps track of the title and content.
    2. Pass the new note back to the App.
    3. Add new note to an array.
    4. Take array and render seperate Note components for each item.

2. Implement the delete note functionality.
    1. Callback from the Note component to trigger a delete function.
    2. Use the filter function to filter out the item that needs deletion.
    3. Pass a id over to the Note component, pass it back to the App when deleting.
